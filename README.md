## Learnings 📚
### How CSS works behind the scenes
- There are three different CSS sources: author, user, and browser (user agent).
- When more than one rule applies to a certain element, CSS first looks at the importance, if they have the same importance, then it looks at the specificity, if they have the same specificity, then finally it looks at the source order.
- How CSS values are processed.
- How percentages and relative values work when specifying font sizes and lengths (%, em, rem, vh, vw).
